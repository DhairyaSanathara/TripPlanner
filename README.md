# AI Budget Travel Planner

A prompt-to-product AI travel planning web app focused on **budget-first decision-making** and **agent-based reasoning**, built with minimal traditional coding.

## Overview

This project explores how **structured prompts** can be used as a system design to build real, working applications.

An AI planning agent is guided to reason about budget constraints, generate itineraries, and make trade-offs instead of simply suggesting destinations.

The app is designed especially for **students and low-budget travelers**.

## Features

- Fixed total budget treated as a hard constraint
- Automatic budget allocation:
  - Travel
  - Stay
  - Food
  - Local transport
  - Activities
  - Emergency buffer
- Day-wise itinerary with estimated daily spend
- Dynamic plan adjustment when budget is exceeded
- Decision explanations and trade-offs
- Student-friendly mode (hostels, public transport, low-cost activities)

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- Agent-based reasoning logic
- Pandas
- Plotly
- Mock data (CSV / SQLite)
